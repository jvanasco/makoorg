<h1>Mako Templates for Python</h1>


<p>Mako is a template library written in Python.  It provides a familiar, non-XML syntax which compiles into Python modules for maximum performance.  Mako's syntax and API borrows from the best ideas of many others, including Django templates, Cheetah, Myghty, and Genshi.  Conceptually, Mako is an embedded Python (i.e. Python Server Page) language, which refines the familiar ideas of componentized layout and inheritance to produce one of the most straightforward and flexible models available, while also maintaining close ties to Python calling and scoping semantics.</p>
<p>Mako is used by the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/pydotorg/website/">python.org website</a> as the basis for their site build system (<a href="https://svn.python.org/www/trunk/beta.python.org/build/README">README</a>), as well as by <a href="http://reddit.com">reddit.com</a> for their newly launched beta site.

<h2>Philosophy:</h2>
<p>Python is a great scripting language.  Don't reinvent the wheel...your templates can handle it !</p>

<h2>Another Templating Language?!</h2>
<p>Well, not totally true.  Mako is in many ways the next generation of the Myghty templating system, and its slated to become the default template language for the Pylons web framework.   Its not Myghty since it has none of Myghty's framework concepts, has a different syntax and conceptual design, and is all original code.  But in many ways its replacing Myghty as an updated, vastly improved, and more Python-centric system which is much better suited to the current generation of WSGI frameworks.   And it does offer features that aren't found in any other template language.
</p>
<h2>Features:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Super-simple API.  For basic usage, just one class, ${code('Template')} is needed:
    <pre><%text filter="trim, h">from mako.template import Template
print Template("hello ${data}!").render(data="world")
    </%text></pre>
    For filesystem management and template caching, add the ${code('TemplateLookup')} class.
    </li>
    
    <li>
    Insanely Fast.  An included bench suite, adapted from a suite included with Genshi, has these results for a simple three-sectioned layout:
    <table id="speedchart">
    <tr><td>Mako:</td><td>1.10 ms</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Myghty:</td><td>4.52 ms</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Cheetah:</td><td>1.10 ms</td><td></td><td>Genshi:</td><td>11.46 ms</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Django:</td><td>2.74 ms</td><td></td><td>Kid:</td><td>14.54 ms</td></tr>
    </table>
    Since a speed test is always a flashpoint for controversy, and you can modify the bench to show different variances, the point here is not that "Mako is faster"; its not meant as a competitive point.  The point is, "Mako is as fast as any of the other currently popular approaches".

    <li>Standard template features
    <ul>
        <li>control structures constructed from real Python code (i.e. loops, conditionals)</li>
        <li>straight Python blocks, inline or at the module-level</li>
        <li>plain old includes</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Callable blocks
    <ul>
        <li>can access variables from their enclosing scope as well as the template's request context</li>
        <li>can be nested arbitrarily</li>
        <li>can specify regular Python argument signatures</li>
        <li>outer-level callable blocks can be called by other templates or controller code (i.e. "method call")</li>
        <li>Calls to functions can define any number of sub-blocks of content which are accessible to the called function (i.e. "component-call-with-content").  This is the basis for nestable custom tags.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Inheritance
        <ul>
        <li>supports "multi-zoned" inheritance - define any number of areas in the base template to be overridden.</li>
        <li>supports "chaining" style inheritance - call <span class="code">next.body()</span> to call the "inner" content.</li>
        <li>the full inheritance hierarchy is navigable in both directions (i.e. parent and child) from anywhere in the chain.</li>
        <li>inheritance is dynamic !  Specify a function instead of a filename to calculate inheritance on the fly for every request.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
</ul>
